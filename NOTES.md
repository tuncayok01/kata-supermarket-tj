# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help us understand your thought process.

- Incremented the java version to 1.9 so that I can use the Collection factory methods.
- Not testing method params for null or valid values due to time constraints
- Added mockito libraries so that I can use mock objects in my unit tests.
